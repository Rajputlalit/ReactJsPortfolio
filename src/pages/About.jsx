        <h4>My Journey</h4>
        <p>
          From learning HTML and CSS two years ago to self-mastering JavaScript and ReactJS today —
          I’ve built everything through practice, mistakes, and curiosity. I believe in understanding
          the “why” behind every concept — whether it’s how props flow in React or how a function manipulates
          the DOM. This mindset helps me write structured, optimized, and user-centered web applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every new skill I learn adds another layer to this journey — and this portfolio itself is the
          reflection of that continuous growth.
